                <p>I work with a chess coaching team because I believe that coaches with different styles complement each other's work. Using subtopics such as openings, middlegame, strategy, tactics, calculation, endgame, technique, and chess culture, and utilizing both computer-based and paper-based textbook packages for self-practice, we strive to make students' chess understanding comprehensive.</p>
                <p>We provide instruction individually, in small groups, and in larger groups. We teach both children and adults. Several of our competitive chess students are national champions and podium finishers.</p>
