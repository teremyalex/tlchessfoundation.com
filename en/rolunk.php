            <div class="kuldetes">
                <p>Generally, it is true that one cannot make a living from chess in Hungary, as there is very little money in the sport. Our mission is to change this by transforming the Hungarian chess culture and elevating it to the level of today's standards. Our main weapon for this is creating live broadcasts and tournament broadcasts, which will bring more sponsor support to Hungarian chess.</p>

                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>The NYH Chess YouTube channel was created in Hungary on November 25, 2022, with the mission to make chess more entertaining. Seeing foreign examples, it became clear that there was a great demand worldwide for chess content, particularly for showcasing competitive chess. It quickly became evident that what seemed like a good idea in theory also worked in practice. After a few months, we surpassed all Hungarian chess content creators in views and subscriber numbers, and today we are by far the largest channel in Europe.</p>

                    <p>The NYH Chess YouTube channel operates under the Trembácz László Chess Foundation. It generates revenue through public funding, tournament organization, grants, and advertising revenue. It is solely owned by Hungarians. We record games at our own and others' organized tournaments. Additionally, we have invested a lot of energy and money into live broadcasting the tournaments, not just recording them for later. Therefore, attracting new sponsors is a daily task.</p>
