                <h2>ON-SITE ADVERTISING PLATFORMS</h2>
                <div style="flex-direction: row-reverse;">
                    <div>
                        <p>There are many opportunities to let players and spectators know who the sponsors of the event are. We can place the sponsors' logos on the sponsor wall, rollups, board numbers, certificates, and even on the awards themselves. There is also an option for product placement, meaning that if a sponsor has a physical product, it can be placed in a designated area on-site or even on the players' tables. In the case of tables, it will also be visible in videos, pictures, and live broadcasts. This could be a drink brand that can easily be placed on the tables.</p>

                        <h4>Tournament notice, Facebook, Instagram</h4>
                        <p>We strive to communicate our event on every possible channel. We create a unique poster design, which we then communicate on all major channels among chess enthusiasts across the country and beyond.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Logo, ad video, and description in YouTube videos</h4>
                        <p>In the videos recorded at the tournament and uploaded later, we place the main sponsor's logo in the bottom right corner. Furthermore, if the sponsor has an ad video introducing themselves and their brand, we can also insert those into the videos. Thus, sponsors appear not only in the live broadcast but also in the videos uploaded later. About 20-30 videos are made per tournament, excluding the live broadcast. Additionally, sponsors are also mentioned in the descriptions of the videos.</p>

                        <p>A professional photographer takes pictures at the event, on which we place the sponsors' logos and then publish them on their Facebook and Instagram channels. These are eagerly shared on social media, spreading organically.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Appearance and color scheme of the live broadcast</h4>
                        <p>We strive to match the color scheme of the live broadcast to that of our main sponsor. Not only does the logo appear everywhere during the broadcast, but the entire appearance is aligned with the main sponsor. For the Giganet Rapid Cup, the main color of Giganet was green, so green was reflected in every scene. This way, the logo fits harmoniously into the broadcast and creates unity.</p>

                        <h4>Giveaway</h4>
                        <p>Between two rounds of the tournament, usually nothing happens, so we use this time to involve viewers in the broadcast with interactive activities. One such method is the giveaway. During the Giganet Rapid Cup, viewers could challenge the commentators to a 1-minute game, and the winner received a one-month Chess.com subscription. In this case, the giveaway was offered by Chess.com.</p>
