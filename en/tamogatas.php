                <p>If we had to answer briefly: on the future of Hungarian chess.</p>
                <p>If we go into more detail, our primary goal is to broadcast Hungarian chess. We want people to be able to make a living from Hungarian chess, and for this, we need to improve its marketability. This can be achieved by broadcasting many and regular tournaments. This way, more and more viewers will watch Hungarian chess. Consequently, more sponsors will support these tournaments, and players will compete for bigger prizes. As a result, more players will make a living from chess, there will be more role models, more young players will emerge. This will start a self-sustaining process.</p>
